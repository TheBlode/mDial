As of December 2015, OFCOM in the UK changed their method for calculating the drop,or abandon, percentage for an outbound dialing campaign. The new formula includes an estimate of the number of drops that were answering machines. They do this by using the agent-answered percentage of answering machines and subtracting that percentage from the number of drops. Then that new drop number is divided by the total agent-answered human-answered calls PLUS the number of drops. This differs in several ways from the way it had been done, as well as the way the drop percentage has been calculated in the USA and Canada. This new UK drop calculation method can be activated as a system setting AND a campaign option. Both must be enabled for the campaign to use the new method. In order for agent-statused answering machines to be calculated properly, we have added an answering machine status flag that is used to gather those statuses. Default is 0 for inactive."); ?>
