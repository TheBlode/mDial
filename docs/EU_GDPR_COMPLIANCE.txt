What is the GDPR?

The right of access (Article 15) is a data subject right that gives citizens the right to get access to their personal data and information about how this personal data is are being processed. A data controller must provide, upon request, an overview of the categories of data that are being processed (Article 15(1)(b)) as well as a copy of the actual data (Article 15(3)). Furthermore, the data controller has to inform the data subject on details about the processing such as the purposes are of the processing (Article 15(1)(a)), with whom the data is shared (Article 15(1)(c)), and how it acquired the data (Article 15(1)(g)).

A right to erasure (Article 17) provides that the data subject has the right to request erasure of personal data related to them on any one of a number of grounds, including noncompliance with Article 6.1 (lawfulness) that includes a case (f) if the legitimate interests of the controller is overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require protection of personal data.

And there are many other sections not directly affecting VICIdial software for affected organizations that you should read about if your organization is affected.


Who is affected by the GDPR?

The regulation applies if the data controller, an organisation that collects data from EU residents, or processor, an organisation that processes data on behalf of data controller like cloud service providers or the data subject (person) is based in the EU. The regulation also applies to organisations based outside the EU if they collect or process personal data of individuals located inside the EU. According to the European Commission, "personal data is any information relating to an individual, whether it relates to his or her private, professional or public life. It can be anything from a name, a home address, a photo, an email address, bank details, posts on social networking websites, medical information, or a computer’s IP address."
