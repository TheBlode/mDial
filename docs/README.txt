This suite of programs is designed to work with the Asterisk Open-source PBX
(http://www.asterisk.org) as a cross-platform GUI client and the supporting 
server side applications necessary for the features of the GUI application to 
work with Asterisk. The client-side GUI apps are available as web pages running
AJAX scripted web pages(Firefox recommended)

End-user Manuals for Agents and Managers are available from http://www.eflo.net

 ***** Description, Notes and Changelog below *****

Included in this distribution of the Asterisk GUI client are:
- agi/ - the Asterisk agi-bin files needed for astguiclient
- bin/ - the astGUIclient server-side perl script applications
- docs/ - astGUIclient installation and other documentation
- docs/conf_examples/ - example Asterisk conf files for astGUIclient
- extras/ - data files, sql files and other extra files needed for ViciDial
- LANG_www/ - ViciDial admin and user web pages translated into other languages
- sounds/ - Asterisk sounds needed by ViciDial
- translations/ - UTF8 language translation files for other language versions
- www/ - the pages and scripts of the user and admin astGUIclient web interface


DESCRIPTION:
This program was designed as a GUI client for the Asterisk PBX with Zaptel 
trunks or IAX or SIP VOIP trunks and SIP/IAX/Zap hard or softphones or devices
as extensions, it could be adapted to other functions, but it was designed for 
Zap/IAX/SIP users. The client programs are web-based and will run on most 
modern web browsers.


KNOWN BUGS:
- With ViciDial(and Asterisk in general) you cannot record a native bridge 
  VOIP-only conversation unless you go into a conference, you also cannot 
  monitor a native-bridge VOIP-only conversation unless you use a separate 
  specialized application like OrecX


VERSION HISTORY:

0.7 - First public release - 2003-11-18
This is the first release of the Asterisk GUI Client code, it is entirely 
written in Perl with portability and rapid development/testing in mind. The perl 
code is NOT strict, it was written loose and fast and has been functioning 
rather well in a production environment of 60 clients for one month now.

0.8 - Second public release - 2003-12-09
- Several bug fixes
- New button for monitoring live extensions on Zap channels
- Changed the method that the live channels/phone were populated on the 
listboxes of the client app.
- Changed the Asterisk/Manager commands to work correctly with new Asterisk CVS 
versions requirements. 
- A new routine was enabled to allow for making sure that the updater is   
running and bringing up a popup alert window on the client if the updater has 
not updated in the last 6 seconds. (this also added a new MySQL table)
- Changed the updater to run every 450 milliseconds instead of every 333 
milliseconds. 
- Updater changed to allow for ringing channels to appear in the live_channels 
table. 

0.9 - Third public release - 2004-02-05
The majority of the work in this release it to make it more stable and fix some 
pretty bad bugs. We created the Asterisk Central Queue System to address the 
problem with buffer-overflows in the manager interface of Asterisk causing total 
system deadlocks. We also completed and touched-up many other features that we 
didn't finish in previous releases. Here is the list of changes:
- Several bug fixes
- Inclusion of listing for active SIP/Local channels and ability to hang them up

- Recording for conferences is now able to record all audio in and out
- Added ability to send DTMF tones within a conference
- Changed alert window for updater being down timeout to 20 seconds
- Added an option for using the new Asterisk Central Queue System(ACQS) that 
reduces the risk of deadlocks that occur with buffer-overflows on remote manager 
interface connections
- Included new script to run at boot time and rotate the logs as well as a 
keepalive script for the new ACQS 
- Changed non-AGI server-side scripts to allow for a single config file
- Detailed activity logging to text file option added
- Activity logging added to all non-AGI server applications

CHANGES:
1. Note the license change from GPLv2 to AGPLv2. This change was made to close the ASP loophole for code distribution that was present in the GPLv2 license. Please read the docs/LICENSE.txt file for more information 
2. Several of the MySQL tables have been changed to a HEAP type to reside in memory to improve performance. 
3. Added the ability for inbound and blended agents to choose their selected in-groups without logging out. The new GROUPS link at the top of the agent screen(vicidial.php) can be used when an agent is Paused to change their selected groups and whether they are set to do Blended calling or not. There is also a new log with the details of what groups an agent has selected each time in the user stats page. 
4. Queue Priority has been added allowing for the prioritization of one in-group over another in-group or outbound campaign(when in blended mode) 
5. Drop call action has been added to both inbound and outbound calling. You can now send a call that would drop into an inbound group. The call will still be recorded as a DROP in it's original in-group or campaign, but the lead information will move on to the drop in-group. 
6. Audio recording mixing/compression/ftping scripts have been completely rewritten and separated into different scripts for better fault tolerance. Also, you have the option of compression in to the following formats: WAV, GSM, MP3 and OGG - AST_CRON_audio_1_move_mix.pl - AST_CRON_audio_1_move_VDonly.pl - AST_CRON_audio_2_compress.pl - AST_CRON_audio_3_ftp.pl 
7. Created a new script to backup a VICIDIAL setup, including the Asterisk conf files, prompt recordings, bin, agi and web files: ADMIN_backup.pl 
8. Added ability to override recording options of a campaign for individual inbound-groups 
9. The 8 outbound agi-VDADtransfer scripts are in process of being consolidated into a single AGI script: agi-VDAD_ALL_outbound.agi All older outbound scripts are depricated and do not function any more 
10. Added the ability to load balance the logins to vicidial.php for phones that are registered to multiple servers on a multi-server system. Simply put multiple phone_login values in the phone login field at login separated by a comma and the vicidial.php script will pick the server that has the fewest agents logged into it at the moment of login. 
11. Added ability for vicidial.php to populate the phones.computer_ip field upon agent login. Options set in the vicidial.php file to allow for overwrite every login or only if field is empty.

25. IMPORTANT FOR RECORDINGS!!! The recording extensions have been changed within VICIDIAL so you need to add the following lines to your extensions.conf ; quiet monitor-only entry and leaving conferences for VICIDIAL (recording) exten => _58600XXX,1,Meetme,${EXTEN:1}|Fmq 
26. Added option (for Internet Explorer users only) to copy a field to the clipboard of the agent computer upon a call being sent to the agent.
